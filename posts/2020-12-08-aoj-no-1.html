<h4 id="dark-room"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=2709">2709 Dark Room</a></h4>
<p>Since only dark rooms matter, let’s consider finding the minimum value of the operation sequence with dynamic programming, representing the dark rooms we’ve visited with the bit sequences. - dp[i][S] = minimum length of the operation sequence by which we can reach a state S for i or less instructions.</p>
<p>Let S’ be a state that can be reached to with the operation k(1&lt;=k&lt;=K) from the state S, then we can obtain a recurrence: - dp[i+1][S] = dp[i][S’] + 1 for all S’</p>
<p>Also, dp[i][S] &lt;= dp[j][S](i &lt; j) holds for all state S. Finally, it is sufficient to compute the transition from each state once and the total runtime complexity is O(KM2^M).</p>
<p>Actually, you can just do the BFS instead of dynamic programming and it is easier and smarter :cry:</p>

<h4 id="vampire"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=1194">1194 Vampire</a></h4>
<p>Since the given integers are less than or equal to 20, we can consider the intervals [i,i+1] for each i (-r&lt;=i&lt;=r). Just move the sun (circle) forward on the y-axis, keeping the maximum height of the building in each interval. Finally, you can use the hypot theorem to get the y-coordinate of the sun.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="marked-ancestor"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=2170">2170 Marked Ancestor</a></h4>
<p>First, we reorder the vertices in in-order to reduce them to 2*N one-dimensional sequence A (in the example in the problem, A = {1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 3, 1} ) (this method is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_tour_technique">euler tour technique</a>) Let’s define some variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>id1[u] = the first index where node u appeared in sequence A,</li>
<li>id2[u] = the last index where node u appeared in column A,</li>
<li>depth[u] = the depth of the node u on the tree,</li>
<li>B[u] = Among the marked ancestors of node u, the number of nodes which has the largest depth (initially all the B elements are 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then each operation corresponds to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>M v: For B[u] (id1[v]&lt;= <span class="math inline">∀<em>u</em></span> &lt;=id2[v]), update B[u] with v if depth[u] &lt; depth[v]</li>
<li>Q v: Add B[id1[v]] to your answer</li>
</ul>
<p>These operations can be done in O(log N) using a segment tree with lazy propagation. Since DFS only takes O(N), the total complexity is O((Q + N) log N). However, the above solution is a little bit heavy to implement. If you read the queries first and precompute, you can solve it with Union Find in backward.</p>

<h4 id="shopping"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=1347">1347 Shopping</a></h4>
<p>Just DP in O(N^2) as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>dp[i] = minimum distance when going all the way from store 1 to store i</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="for-the-peace"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=2176">2176 For the Peace</a></h4>
<p>Problem(the original is a little difficult to understand) :</p>
<p>Let’s consider the next operation, where <span class="math inline"><em>A</em>[<em>i</em>] = <em>c</em><sub><em>i</em>, 1</sub> + ... + <em>c</em><sub><em>i</em>, <em>m</em><em>i</em></sub></span>,</p>
<ul>
<li>For given i, subtract <span class="math inline"><em>c</em><sub><em>i</em>, <em>j</em></sub></span> from A[i] (j is a constant satisfying 1 &lt;= j &lt;= mi)</li>
</ul>
<p>Can all A[i] be set to 0 by repeating the operation, keeping the conditoin <span class="math inline"><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>x</em>(<em>A</em>[<em>i</em>]) − <em>m</em><em>i</em><em>n</em>(<em>A</em>[<em>i</em>]) ≤ <em>D</em></span>?</p>
<p>The operation can be divided into four cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Op1. Only max(A[i]) and min(A[i]) decrease</li>
<li>Op2. Only max(A[i]) decreases</li>
<li>Op3. Only min(A[i]) decreases</li>
<li>Op4. Neither max(A[i]) nor min(A[i]) decreases</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, when there are multiple possible operations, the order in which they are performed doesn’t matter. For example, in the state A[i], where the operations by Op1 and Op2 are possible, let A’‘[i] be the state after Op1 performed in A[i] and A’’‘[i] be the state after Op2 performed in A[i], then it is easy to see that max(A’‘[i]) == max(A’’’[i]). That means whichever operation you do first, you can transition to the same state. In other words, to get all A[i] to zero, you only need to perform one of the operations that are possible in each state.<br />
Conversely, if there are no possible operations in a state, it is impossible to set all A[i] to zero. Finding possible operations can be done by O(n log n) using BST(I just used <code>std::set</code>). The total runtime complexity is O(M * n log n) (<span class="math inline"><em>M</em> = ∑<sub><em>i</em></sub><em>m</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>). In fact, we implemented the above operation in reverse (i.e., adding instead of subtracting).</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="http://acm-icpc.aitea.net/index.php?plugin=attach&amp;refer=2009%2FPractice%2F%E6%A8%A1%E6%93%AC%E5%9C%B0%E5%8C%BA%E4%BA%88%E9%81%B8%2F%E8%AC%9B%E8%A9%95&amp;openfile=b.pdf">the official solution</a>, there seem to be smarter and better ways to find possible operations.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="starting-line"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=2298">2298 Starting Line</a></h4>
<p>Let’s consider moving by one meter at a time. It is clear that <em>if acceleration is possible at each point, then it is better to accelerate</em>, so we can simulate in O(L) with greedy strategy. Is the constraint a trick or there is another way to solve it?</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="surface-area-of-cubes"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=2723">2723 Surface Area of Cubes</a></h4>
<p>Just add and subtract the surface area while removing cubes. Subtract from the answer if any adjacent blocks are excluded. Be careful about the boundaries. The complexity is O(N^2).</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="dictionary"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=2534">2534 Dictionary</a></h4>
<p>Make directed graphs in the order of alphabets that can be determined from a given input. For example, create an edge k’ <span class="math inline">→</span> k, if k &lt; k’ for each character k and k’. If the graph has no cycle, we can say they are in lexicographic order. We can detect any cycle by DFS.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="infinity-maze"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=2320">2320 Infinity Maze</a></h4>
<p>Since the number of states is at most 4 * H * W, any move which took more than <span class="math inline">4 * <em>H</em> * <em>W</em></span> includes a loop. So, we only have to simulate in O(HW).</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="eleven-lover"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=2182">2182 Eleven Lover</a></h4>
<p>Digit DP:</p>
<ul>
<li>dp[i][j] = the total number of k such that S[k]…. S[i] mod 11 is equal to j ,</li>
</ul>
<p>Be careful not to count the leading-zero digit numbers.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="dial-lock"><a href="http://judge.u-aizu.ac.jp/onlinejudge/description.jsp?id=2157">2157 Dial Lock</a></h4>
<p>First, we can see that the difference between the initial state and the target state only matters. Then we see that we have to find the minimum number of operations for a sequence A[i] of length k consisting of numbers between 0 and 9, adding t (-9&lt;=t&lt;=9) to the consecutive intervals to obtain 0 mod 10. If we try to implement this in a straightforward way, the number of states is O(10^k) and we cannot find them in time. So let A[i] be A<a href="1%20%3C=%20l%20%3C=%20k">l</a>, then any sequence of operations with A[l] which is the leftmost end of the interval can be divided into</p>
<ul>
<li>set A[l] to 0</li>
<li>an operation sequence for (A[l+1] … A[n]).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the operations: - adding a to [l,r] and adding b to [l, r’] (l &lt;= r &lt; r’ &lt;= k)</p>
<p>correspond to</p>
<ul>
<li>adding a + b to [l, r] and adding b to [r + 1, r’]</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also see that the operation of adding t (-9&lt;=t&lt;=-1) to the interval is replaced by adding 10 + t. Therefore, it is sufficient to find the minimum number of operations , repeating only the operation that makes the leftmost end of the array 0. Since there are O(k - l) operations to set A[l] to 0 and each operation takes O(k), the total runtime complexity is O(k! * k).</p>
<p>The above solution is almost the same as <a href="http://acm-icpc.aitea.net/index.php?plugin=attach&amp;refer=2009%2FPractice%2F%E5%A4%8F%E5%90%88%E5%AE%BF%2F%E8%AC%9B%E8%A9%95&amp;%20openfile=2c.pdf">the official solution</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, I realized the differences don’t matter. At first, I thought of enumerating half of the states, but the number of states is not less than O(10^k), so it was useless.</p>
